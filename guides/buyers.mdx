# Buyers

In Polinate, a "buyer" is a bundle of multiple underlying resources that work together.
There are two bundle types, but only one is creatable via API.

<Info>
You can only create <strong>phantom buyers</strong> via the API. Platform buyers are created by accounts that use the Polinate app directly.
</Info>

## Buyer bundle types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Platform buyer">
    A business running on Polinate. Created and managed inside the Polinate platform.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Phantom buyer">
    A business <em>not</em> on Polinate. Creatable via API and used to transact with your supplier account.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What happens when you create a buyer

Creating a buyer via the API orchestrates several resources in a specific order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Partnership is created">
    We establish the relationship between your supplier business and the new buyer bundle.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Phantom (buyer organization) is created">
    This represents the buyer's organization container where contact data is stored.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Phantom buyer is created">
    The buyer entity shares the <strong>same unique ID</strong> as the parent phantom.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Ownership model

- <strong>Phantom (buyer organization)</strong>: owns locations, phones, and emails.
- <strong>Partnership</strong>: owns the relationship to your supplier and is where orders and invoices are associated.
- <strong>Phantom buyer</strong>: shares the same ID as the phantom.

## Relationship map

```text
Supplier (you)
└─ Partnership (prt_...)
   ├─ Buyer Phantom (pha_...)  ← same ID as Phantom Buyer
   │  ├─ Locations
   │  ├─ Emails
   │  └─ Phones
   ├─ Orders
   └─ Invoices
```

## Fetching buyers vs. partnerships

When you "fetch buyers" for a supplier, you're actually retrieving <strong>partnerships</strong>.
Use each partnership's linked phantom to access the buyer's contact details (locations, phones, emails).

## Authentication

Include the following headers in every request:
- `X-Business-ID`: Your business identifier
- `X-API-Key`: Your API key

## Create a Buyer

Creates a <strong>phantom buyer bundle</strong> by creating a partnership, phantom, and phantom buyer. You can start minimal and add contact/location data later.

Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/buyers`

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://integrations.polinate.ai/api/v1/buyers" \
  -H "X-Business-ID: {{businessId}}" \
  -H "X-API-Key: {{apiKey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "buyer": {
      "name": "Acme Pty Ltd",
      "legalName": "Acme Pty Ltd"
    }
  }'
```

```json Successful Response
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "buy_123"
}
```

```json Unauthorized
{
  "errorCode": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "requestId": "{{requestId}}"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
This operation is idempotent when you provide an <code>Idempotency-Key</code>. Repeating the same key returns the original result.
</Note>

## Notes

- Optional arrays `emails`, `phones`, and `locations` can be provided when creating a buyer.
- Use `Idempotency-Key` header for safe retries on POST requests.
