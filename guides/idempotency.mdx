# Idempotency

Idempotency lets you safely retry POST requests without creating duplicate resources.

## Header

Include an `Idempotency-Key` header on POST requests. Reusing the same key will return the original result for duplicates.

## Example

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://integrations.polinate.ai/api/v1/items" \
  -H "X-Business-ID: {{businessId}}" \
  -H "X-API-Key: {{apiKey}}" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: {{idempotencyKey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "item": {"name": "Widget", "handle": "widget-1", "type": "OTHER", "status": "ACTIVE"},
    "variants": [{"variantName": "Default", "currency": "AUD", "price": 12.34, "cost": 8.5}]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Notes

- Use a unique key per logical operation.
- Keys should be unique and stable across retries.
