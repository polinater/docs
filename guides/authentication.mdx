# API Authentication

The Polinate API uses a simple header-based authentication system that requires two key pieces of information from your business settings. This guide will walk you through finding your credentials and implementing authentication in your requests.

<Info>
All API requests must include both the Business ID and API Key headers for successful authentication.
</Info>

## Authentication Overview

Our API uses header-based authentication with two required headers:
- `X-Business-ID`: Your unique business identifier
- `X-API-Key`: Your secret API key for secure access



## Finding Your Credentials

Your authentication credentials are located in your Polinate business settings. Follow these steps to locate them:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Business Settings">
    Log into your Polinate dashboard at [supplier.polinate.ai](https://supplier.polinate.ai) and navigate to your business settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access the Integrations Section">
    In the business settings, look for the **Integrations** section in the sidebar or main navigation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy Your Credentials">
    You'll find two important values:
    - **Business ID**: A unique identifier for your business
    - **API Key**: A secret key used for authentication
    
    <Warning>
    Keep your API Key secure and never share it publicly. Treat it like a password.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation Examples

Here's how to include the authentication headers in your API requests:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.polinate.ai/v1/your-endpoint" \
  -H "X-Business-ID: your-business-id-here" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key-here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript/Node.js
const response = await fetch('https://api.polinate.ai/v1/your-endpoint', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'X-Business-ID': 'your-business-id-here',
    'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key-here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-Business-ID': 'your-business-id-here',
    'X-API-Key': 'your-api-key-here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.polinate.ai/v1/your-endpoint',
    headers=headers
)

data = response.json()
```

```php PHP
<?php
$headers = [
    'X-Business-ID: your-business-id-here',
    'X-API-Key: your-api-key-here',
    'Content-Type: application/json'
];

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://api.polinate.ai/v1/your-endpoint');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);

$response = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);

$data = json_decode($response, true);
?>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Authentication Headers Reference

<ResponseField name="X-Business-ID" type="string" required>
  Your unique business identifier found in the Integrations section of your business settings.
  
  **Example**: `bus_1234567890abcdef`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="X-API-Key" type="string" required>
  Your secret API key for authentication. This key should be kept secure and never exposed in client-side code.
  
  **Example**: `1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`
</ResponseField>

 

## Error Response

Authentication errors return the following response when the provided headers are missing, invalid, or do not match your business credentials:

```json
{
  "errorCode": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "requestId": "{{requestId}}"
}
```

- **errorCode**: Always `UNAUTHORIZED` for authentication failures.
- **message**: A human-readable description of the error.
- **requestId**: An identifier for the request, useful when contacting support.
