# Pricing

Pricing revolves around the Item List, which is a price list owned by a supplier and expanded with richer pricing functionality.

<Info>
An <strong>Item List</strong> is a price list plus extras (taxes, costs, branching, and global adjustments). Most partners treat it as a simple price list.
</Info>

## Item List structure

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Partnership assignments">
    Array of partnerships (buyers) this Item List is applied to. Assigned partnerships get these prices, which override the buyer’s default item variant prices.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Entries (variant joins)">
    Array of entries that each link to an Item Variant. Each entry overrides pricing fields (e.g., price, currency) for that variant under this Item List.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Global overrides">
    The Item List can include global percentage adjustments (e.g., discount factors) that apply across entries.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Default Item List

<Info>
Every supplier has a <strong>Default Item List</strong>. It is automatically applied to all newly created buyers (partnerships) when no specific Item List is assigned.
</Info>

- No global overrides are applied on the Default Item List.
- Entries on the Default Item List do not override pricing; prices come from the underlying Item Variant.
- When new Items are created, <strong>all variants are automatically included</strong> on the Default Item List.
- If a partnership is later assigned a specific Item List, that assignment overrides the Default Item List for that partnership.

## Relationship map

```text
Supplier (you)
└─ Item List (owned by supplier)
   ├─ Partnerships [prt_...] (assignments; 1 list per partnership)
   └─ Entries [→ Item Variants] (override variant price under this list)
```

## Fetching item lists

When fetching an Item List, we group entries by their parent Items for readability. Conceptually, it’s still a list of <strong>variants</strong> and a list of <strong>partnerships</strong>.

## Constraints

- Each partnership can have <strong>at most one</strong> assigned Item List.
- All partnerships and item variants referenced must already exist.

## Authentication

Include the following headers in every request:
- `X-Business-ID`: Your business identifier
- `X-API-Key`: Your API key

## Create an Item List

Creates an Item List and one or more entries, and optionally assigns partnerships.

Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/pricing`

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://integrations.polinate.ai/api/v1/pricing" \
  -H "X-Business-ID: {{businessId}}" \
  -H "X-API-Key: {{apiKey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "itemListData": { "label": "Winter 2025" },
    "entries": [
      { "itemListId": "list_123", "itemVariantId": "var_123", "price": 10, "currency": "AUD" }
    ],
    "partnerships": ["prt_123"]
  }'
```

```json Successful Response
{
  "success": true
}
```

```json Unauthorized
{
  "errorCode": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "requestId": "{{requestId}}"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
This operation is idempotent when you provide an <code>Idempotency-Key</code>. Repeating the same key returns the original result.
</Note>

## Notes

- Include at least one entry in `entries`.
- Use `Idempotency-Key` header for safe retries on POST requests.
