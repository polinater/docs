Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/pricing`

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://integrations.polinate.ai/api/v1/pricing" \
  -H "X-Business-ID: {{businessId}}" \
  -H "X-API-Key: {{apiKey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "itemListData": { "label": "Winter 2025" },
    "entries": [
      { "itemListId": "list_123", "itemVariantId": "var_123", "price": 10, "currency": "AUD" }
    ],
    "partnerships": ["prt_123"]
  }'
```

```json Successful Response

  "success": true
}
```

{
  "errorCode": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Unauthorized",

- Use `Idempotency-Key` header for safe retries on POST requests.
