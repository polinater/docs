# Items

An "item" is a bundle that groups a parent Item with one or more Item Variants and ownership-specific records. The external API lets you create platform item bundles.

<Info>
You can only create <strong>platform item bundles</strong> via the API. Phantom item bundles exist (for phantom suppliers) but are not creatable externally.
</Info>

## Item bundle structure

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Parent Item">
    The <strong>parent resource</strong> that holds core fields (name, handle, type, status). <strong>Variants are attached to this Item</strong>.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Ownership layer">
    <strong>Platform Item</strong> is an <em>extension</em> of the Item that stores ownership/diverged fields. It <strong>shares the same ID</strong> as the parent Item. Phantom item extensions exist but are not creatable via the external API.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Variants (the real meat)">
    Variants hold pricing, cost, SKU/barcode, dimensions, and more. Every item must have at least one variant — a single-variant item typically uses a variant named "Default" (similar to Shopify's model).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What happens when you create an item

Creating an item via the API orchestrates resources in this order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Parent Item is created">
    Defines the container and core metadata for the item. Variants will attach to this parent Item.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Platform Item is created">
    Ownership-specific <em>extension</em> record for your supplier business that <strong>uses the same ID</strong> as the parent Item.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Variants are created">
    One or more variants are attached to the <strong>parent Item</strong>. At least one is required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Relationship map

```text
Supplier (you)
└─ Item (parent, itm_...)
   ├─ Platform Item (extension, same id as Item)
   └─ Variants (one or more)
```

## Authentication

Include the following headers in every request:
- `X-Business-ID`: Your business identifier
- `X-API-Key`: Your API key

## Create an Item

Creates a <strong>platform item bundle</strong> with a parent Item and one or more Variants.

Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/items`

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://integrations.polinate.ai/api/v1/items" \
  -H "X-Business-ID: {{businessId}}" \
  -H "X-API-Key: {{apiKey}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "item": {
      "name": "Widget",
      "handle": "widget-1",
      "type": "OTHER",
      "status": "ACTIVE"
    },
    "variants": [
      {
        "variantName": "Default",
        "currency": "AUD",
        "price": 12.34,
        "cost": 8.5
      }
    ]
  }'
```

```json Successful Response
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "itm_123"
}
```

```json Unauthorized
{
  "errorCode": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "requestId": "{{requestId}}"
}
```
</CodeGroup>


<Note>
This operation is idempotent when you provide an <code>Idempotency-Key</code>. Repeating the same key returns the original result.
</Note>

## Notes

- Provide at least one variant in `variants`.
- Use `Idempotency-Key` header for safe retries on POST requests.
